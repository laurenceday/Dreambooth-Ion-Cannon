    "    It is based off of \"The Repo Formerly Known As Dreambooth\" by Joe Penna and his many extraordinarily talented collaborators, and further tweaks to the training process have been made by my friend Kane Wallmann. I am in awe of them, and owe them all a bottle of something from the top shelf.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This variant of the repository is not an \"improvement\" per se - rather, it is a simplification of the process of\n",
    "    image generation by virtue of abstracting away details such as requiring you to interface with external sites, and\n",
    "    providing some prompts that I've found work quite well across the board.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There is still a level of technical know-how required, however you - the intended audience - are unlikely to be\n",

    "    Over the course of a first run of this repository, approximately 5.2GB will be downloaded (excluding packages).\n",
