    "    The first thing I need to say is that this is not original work.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    It is based off of \"The Repo Formerly Known As Dreambooth\" by Joe Penna and his many extraordinarily talented collaborators, and further tweaks to the training process have been made by my friend Kane Wallmann. I am in awe of them, and owe them all a bottle of something from the top shelf.\n",

    "    Dreambooth is a phenomenal piece of work, despite being described as 'walking through a jungle without a torch'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This variant of the repository is not an \"improvement\" per se - rather, it is a simplification of the process of\n",
    "    image generation by virtue of abstracting away details such as requiring you to interface with external sites, and\n",
    "    providing some prompts that I've found work quite well across the board.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The cost to this abstraction is a significantly larger base repository, coming out at 4.8 gigabytes. Them's the breaks.\n",

    "          The long and short of it is that so long as you don't approach this tool with ill intent, you're fine.\n",
    "        * Despite Kane's adjustments enabling multi-subject training, this repo *at present* is designed to only accept \n",
    "          one subject at a time - that's what the prompts are expecting, so training multiple people is a waste. In future\n",
